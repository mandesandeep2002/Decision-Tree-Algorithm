# Project Title: 

# Prediction of "iris.csv" dataset for Decision Tree Algorithm using Supervised learning Machine Algorithm

# Problem Statement:

# American based Botonical Gardens grow iris flower in their Labs but using Bio-techonology in a single tree different varities of flowers are grown.As a DataScience Engineer find out accuracy of all categories of flowers contain same species.
